Simple Login and Dashboard for user management.

Understanding the Ui & UI:

The instruction for this project demanded two front-end (For User and Administrators).

Although we were informed to authenticate for Admins specifically, I feel it makes sense to authenticate for end users as well since they re required to provide a sensitive information such as their SSN, also this is reasonable if i want to prevent DDOS and Brute force attacks on the entry form.

The Project Consists of Pages :

Slide Page (How to use the App)
Login Page (Where to login as user or admin)
Register Page (where to register as user)
Profile Page (where to edit your profile and monitor earnings)
Workers Page (Admin Page to see all user, as assign privileges to users or view SSN)

Stack Used;

FrontEnd :  HTML5, JS, CSS, HBS
BackEnd : NODEJS, EXPRESS, FIREBASE CLOUD FUNCTIONS
DataBase : Firebase NOSQL
Authentication : Firebase Auth
Encryption : AES-256
